FSExploitMe -
By Brad.Antoniewicz@foundstone.com (@brad_anton)
		
A purposely vulnerable ActiveX control for learning exploitation. Everything
is browser based to guide the student towards browser exploitation however
these vulnerabilities are really in the ActiveX Control, not the browser itself. 

There are some limitations. For instance, L3HeapSpray() only works on IE8. You'll
need a newer heapsray function to complete Lesson 3 on newer browsers. 

Answers are specifically blank in this release. If you'd like to access them, 
please contact me and I'll send them to you, assuming you're not one of my
students :)
